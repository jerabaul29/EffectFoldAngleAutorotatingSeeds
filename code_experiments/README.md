# Code for analyzing data from experiments

In this folder the Python files that analyze the images from the experiments are located. The code was last tested for Python 2.7.15rc1, on an Ubuntu 18.04.2 system. The packages used are scipy, fnmatch, numpy, matplotlib, tqdm, pickle and shutil.

# Organization of the folder

## Scripts

These are the main scripts used to generate the experimental data in both papers.

- The **generate_data.py** takes in experimental images, and calculates the position of the wing tips and the seed pod at each frame and saves this data. Also reads a reference image to convert from pxl to mm.

- The **select_valid_range.py** reads the data resulting from the previously mentioned script. A plot showing the x and y coordinates of the seed pod as a function of time is shown. Click on the plot to select the first and last frame, which gives the range to be used for calculating vertical velocity and frequency.

- The **process_valid_range_data.py** finds the vertical velocity and frequency of the seed. Plots will pop up that allows the user to select the appropriate frequency peak, this is to make sure that the rotation frequency is the one that is used.

- The **collect_all_data.py** collects the data generated by the previous scripts. And creates a single dictionary that contains all the data.
