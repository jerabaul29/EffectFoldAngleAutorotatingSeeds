# Effect of wing fold angle on the flight properties of autorotating seeds

A repo containing a baseline CAD file, images of real-world seeds, and a simple blade element model to analyze the effect of wing fold angle on the flight dynamics of autorotating seeds.

The material will be published as open source upon publication of our article currently under review.
