# rewrite_flying_seed_model

The folders contain:

- **model**: the phenomenological blade-elements model.

- **CAD**: the baseline parametric CAD file (should use FreeCAD version 0.17, as obtained from apt-get on Ubuntu 16.04. More recent versions introduced API and model description changes that may break backwards compatibility). In addition, there is a small tutorial (from course MEK 3230) on how to build a similar CAD geometry. The CAD geometry is a bit different compared to what is written in the tutorial, but the tutorial should be enough to get you started with the CAD designing.

- **code_experiments**: the code used for image processing.
